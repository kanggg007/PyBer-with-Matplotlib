# PyBer-with-MatplotlibOverview:

In this project, I am assigned to analyze the data given to me to determine was a correlation between type of city and fare.  In addition to my analysis, I also created visualizations based on the data. These were the key insight that I found as per requested, I will give three recommendations to decision maker for addressing any disparities among the city types. 

There is a correlation between number of rides and the average fare per city. Urban cities the highest number of rides, the highest number of drivers and had the lowest average fare of the three types of cities. Urban cities have the highest percentage of total fares at 62.97%.

However, average fare per ride and average fare per driver has shown perfectly opposite directions. In order to address this disparity, there are three ways could be considered. 

1.	I extract date and generate the data frame with date and average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Pyber should send more drivers to suburban area during the last two weeks of every month as there is huge competition in urban area, so the average fare per driver only has less than one third compare with rural area.
2.	Total ride of suburban is slightly over one third of urban but total fare is more than half of urban. Pyber make discount per fare so that more people will take a ride. 
3.	Donâ€™t send driver or make an advertisement at rural even though average fare three times more than urban. 

This project was done completely in my Jupyter Notebook. To do my analysis, I used the Pandas and Numpy Python libraries. I used the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create my visualizations.
